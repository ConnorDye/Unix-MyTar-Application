Hi professor. I started this assignment early and put about 40 + hours in.

I was having some problems with extract and I could not pinpoint the issue. 
When I tested it manually, my program seemed to extract the file correctly
and could extract the directories correctly, however I am failing the majority
of the test cases. I spent a lot of time on the extraction module, and I think
my logic is there, but I might be missing something small thats making me 
fail some of those test cases.
